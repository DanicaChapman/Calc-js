# Calc-js
A calculator that will perform basic mathematical operations

This project was my first introducton to CSS and HTML. It was also my first time using Javascript to 
perform mathematical operations. The calculator can add, subtract, divide and multiply numbers. It can 
even handle parenthesis in mathematical computations while still maintaining the order of opertaions. The 
calculator will display "error" if it is given an incomplete or invalid operation.

Hope you enjoy!
